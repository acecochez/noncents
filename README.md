# US-change-calculator
Calculates left-over change from buying an item with amount of money inputted.

There is a "cash register" that shows the price of an "item" and has some USD coins/notes available to return as "change".

The user inputs an amount into the text box (e.g. 100) and the program will calculate whether the user can afford the "item" & whether "change" is needed (if the user has paid the exact amount needed)
The program then calculates the amount of "change" needed & whether the cash register has the correct notes/coins to return the exact amount needed.

The amount of "change" and coins/notes change as "change" is returned & the price of the "item" is received.

Once all "change" is used up, the "cash register" will set to "closed".

This is a project for the "JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures" certification by freeCodeCamp.org

Check the "Wiki" page to see documentation, there are also notes in the code to help understanding.
